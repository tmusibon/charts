description: Data transformation is a required function for most B2B and A2A integration
  patterns, and is critical in many industries such as Healthcare claims processing
  and Financial Services payments adjudication.  Individual transactions are received
  from a trading partner in a bulk file.  These transactions need to separated, validated
  (to ensure you have the correct information form the trading partner), translated
  into an internal format (eg, XML->X12N), and correlated for those trading partners.  IBM
  Sterling Transformation Extender Advanced (ITXA) provides a modular infrastructure
  for highly available and scalable data transformation and document processing. It
  provides automated sequencing of document processing functions such as enveloping,
  de-enveloping, acknowledgement, transformation, metadata capture for transactions,
  and data for reporting and analytics.    Documentation Additional information about
  installation can be found at https://ibm.biz/Bdfpax.  License IBM Transformation
